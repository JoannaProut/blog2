My name is Joanna Prout and I began my professional career as a social worker, then received my PhD in clinical psychology. I am passionate about using data to improve behavioral healthcare.  This my website to post #TidyTuesday and other #rstats projects.

This is a "hello world" example website for the [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package. The theme was forked from [@jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme) and modified by [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium).
