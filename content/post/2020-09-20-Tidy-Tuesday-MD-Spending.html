<p>For this TidyTuesday Challenge we worked with a dataset provied by Joshua Rosenberg (<a href="https://twitter.com/jrosenberg6432" class="uri">https://twitter.com/jrosenberg6432</a>) showing categories of public spending on children in the US by state and year.</p>
<p>I limited the data to Maryland and the years of 2011-2016 and used a “bumpchart” to look at the ranking of categories of spending over time (from most money to least money spent).</p>
<p>Maryland consistently spent the most money on PK-12 Education, followed by other healh services excluding Medicaid/CHIP.</p>
<p>I also noticed that spending on unemployment and the Child Tax Credit (CTC) decreased over this 5 year period.</p>
