      <description>My name is Joanna Prout and I began my professional career as a social worker, then received my PhD in clinical psychology. I am passionate about using data to improve behavioral healthcare. This my website to post #TidyTuesday and other #rstats projects.
This is a &amp;ldquo;hello world&amp;rdquo; example website for the blogdown package. The theme was forked from @jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme and modified by Yihui Xie.</description>

      <description>For this Tidy Tuesday challenge we used data files from Our World in Data describing crop yields across the globe from 1960-present. Data can be found at https://ourworldindata.org/crop-yields
Peas seemed appealing at the time and I never see them growing here in Marylandâ€“ where do they come from?
I plotted a line graph with tons of peas produced per hectare on the y-axis, year (range from 1990 to 2020) on the x-axis, and continent as line color.</description>
