      <description>For this TidyTuesday Challenge we worked with a dataset provied by Joshua Rosenberg (https://twitter.com/jrosenberg6432) showing categories of public spending on children in the US by state and year.
I limited the date to Maryland and the years of 2011-2016 and used a “bumpchart” to look at the ranking of categories of spending over time (from most money to least money spent).
Maryland consistently spent the most money on PK-12 Education, followed by other healh services excluding Medicaid/CHIP.</description>

      <description>For this Tidy Tuesday challenge we used data files from Our World in Data describing crop yields across the globe from 1960-present. Data can be found at https://ourworldindata.org/crop-yields
Peas seemed appealing at the time and I never see them growing here in Maryland– where do they come from?
I plotted a line graph with tons of peas produced per hectare on the y-axis, year (range from 1990 to 2020) on the x-axis, and continent as line color.</description>
